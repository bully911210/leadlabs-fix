# Environment Variables for LeadLabs

# Email API Endpoint (Required for production email functionality)
# This should point to your deployed serverless function
# Example for Vercel: https://your-project.vercel.app/api/send-email
# Example for Netlify: https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/send-email
VITE_EMAIL_API_ENDPOINT=

# Note: The RESEND_API_KEY should NEVER be set here or in the frontend code.
# It must be set as an environment variable in your serverless platform:
# - Vercel: Settings → Environment Variables
# - Netlify: Site settings → Environment variables
# - AWS Lambda: Configuration → Environment variables
